# omniserve

A lightweight **multimodal LLM inference engine** with continuous batching and a
vision-embedding cache, built to run a vision-language model (Qwen2-VL-2B) on a
**single 8 GB consumer GPU** (RTX 4060 Laptop). Inspired by / benchmarked
against SGLang-Omni and vLLM.

> Goal: demonstrate the core serving-engine techniques — iteration-level
> scheduling, KV-cache management, and multimodal-specific optimizations — in a
> small, readable codebase rather than reproducing a production framework.

## Why
Multimodal serving has a cost that text-only serving does not: the vision
encoder (ViT) re-runs for every request, and identical images (multi-turn chat,
repeated system images) get re-encoded needlessly. On a memory-constrained GPU
this wastes both compute and the activation memory budget. omniserve caches
vision-tower outputs by image content so repeated images skip the encoder.

        └─ vision embedding cache  ◄── the differentiating optimization
```

## Status
- [x] Request / Sequence data model (`request.py`)
- [x] Continuous-batching scheduler (`scheduler.py`)
- [x] Engine step loop + streaming deltas (`engine.py`)
- [x] Backend interface + `StubRunner` (control plane tested without a GPU)
- [x] 4-bit model load validated on RTX 4060 (peak **2.1 GB** VRAM, see below)
- [ ] `QwenVLRunner`: real prefill/decode + KV cache + vision cache
- [ ] OpenAI-compatible server with SSE streaming
- [ ] Benchmark harness vs. vLLM / SGLang-Omni

## Validated on RTX 4060 Laptop (8 GB)
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, 4-bit NF4:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| load time | 2.5 s |
| VRAM after load | 1453 MiB |
| **peak VRAM** | **2107 MiB** / 8188 |
| decode speed | 15.3 tok/s |

The ~6 GB of headroom is what makes concurrent continuous batching feasible on
this GPU.

## Quickstart
```bash
conda activate vllm_bench        # torch 2.9 + transformers 4.57
# control-plane demo, no GPU/model needed:
python -c "from omniserve import LLMEngine, Request, StubRunner; \
  e=LLMEngine(StubRunner()); e.add_request(Request(prompt='hi')); print(e.run_until_complete())"
# model sanity check (requires the weights in the HF cache):
python scripts/check_model.py
```

## Layout
- `omniserve/` — the engine package (scheduler, engine, runner, data model)
- `scripts/` — standalone checks (e.g. `check_model.py`)
- `benchmarks/` — workload + benchmark harness (WIP)
